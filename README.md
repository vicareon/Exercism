This is the repository of all my submitted Exercism exercises.

I started my journey on August 21, 2022 and I'm currently in the Java track. It's a fun way to review and practice fundamental concepts. I hope to make a habit out of it - so far, I practice every day in the morning for two pomodoro timers of 50 minutes each. I also limited myself to only use the official Java Documentation.

First I try to implement the solution. I give the exercise a break for a few days and then go back and see if I can refactor it.
